# A Weather App

This is a website designed to tell users what type of day to expect and how to dress accordingly depending on where the user lives It will help prep clothes for the day. The website will give users an idea of what to wear depending on the weather conditions and temperature. 

We will continue to work on our WTWR app by integrating a temperature unit toggle at the bottom using React. Context, a profile page using React Router, we then have a form submission for adding clothing items to our weather API, and finally, create a mock server for our API interactions.


## Functionality

- Upon entering the site the user will see the weather's condition depending on where they live and temperature status, giving the users an idea of what type of clothes to wear for the day.
Now the user will have the option to add the type of clothes they feel like they should wear. Whether they want to add more or not will be up to them. 
The user will have three choices to choose from whether it will be hot, warm, or cold. 

- The key features we implemented were as follows: we created the toggle button switch in order to switch between weather types, so we are giving the user access to read the weather in Fahrenheit or Celsius. 

- After that, we create the profile component along with a sidebar. We then implement the Routes by installing them in our project and configuring them. Next, we implement the link, which we can access by installing the routes in our project.

- Then we created a clothing item component with a controlled input. We handled the form submission to update, along with the ability to delete whichever item the user would like to delete from our page. 
Finally, we added the finishing touches, including a mock server that will allow us run a mock database allowing the users to add and remove cards in the app according to thier prefrence.
